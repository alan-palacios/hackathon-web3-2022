				With The Chain Hub, we propose to simplify the way a person can navigate the web3, with a DApp that offers the user a list of other contracts running on the same Blockchain, which can be categorized by type of application (such as dao, dex, or gamefi) and searched through keywords, which can find the DApps based on their name, description, or tags.
				In addition, developers will find a simple and fast way to include their applications in the list through a form that they will find on the homepage.
			</p>
			<p>
				We extend the structure proposed by Rust for the metadata of the DNS registry, in order to provide more personalized categorization to the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next steps are to improve the User Experience, so that it can interact on the web3 as easily as it can currently do on the web2, with the added advantages that decentralized internet offers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, create a process that facilitates and guides the developer to include the format in their smart contract and guides them in uploading the program to the blockchain.
